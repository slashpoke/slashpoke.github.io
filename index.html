    <div id = "about">
        <p>I'm slashpoke. I started my coding journey in March 2022. I will use this page to record
            my progress. This site will continually evolve as I work towards my goal of working 
            from a local html doc to publishing this to my own domain. I plan to incorporate HTML, 
            CSS, and JS as I develop skills in all three.

            <p> Been busy with house work but I have been working through the JS course on codecademy.
                <br/><br/>
                Objects are really neat. I did have some trouble with set/get syntax that I wanted to record. The project was to create a menu object 
                that would run input through simple typeof validation before setting the requested value.
                <br/><br/>\
                I found this site that will take a github link to a file and create code to embed the file in html: https://emgithub.com/
                <script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fslashpoke%2Fslashpoke.github.io%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fobject%2520set-get.js&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on"></script>

            <h3>March 26, 2022</h3>
            <p> Today I created slashpoke.html to start my blog. This was based on the recommendation
                of Ryan H. After discussing the project with him, he said a local html file would
                be a good place to start, so here we are!
                <br/><br/>
                Today I made a couple tweets about BTC. Let's see if I can link them. 
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Slashpoke/status/1507785496294195200" target="_blank">BTC Daily Chart</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Slashpoke/status/1507786247703789570" target="_blank">BTC Weekly Chart</a></li>
                </ul>
                I created an unordered list and added a couple links to the daily and weekly chart tweets. 
                I also embedded the daily chart tweet copying embed code from Twitter.
                <br/><br/>
                Ryan T recommended creating a GitHub private repo. They allow free page hosting and I could probably
                redirect my url to it. Private repos can't be hosted free, so I created a public repo.
                Downloaded GitHub desktop and linked to VS Code. 
                <br/><br/>
                Started setting up DNS redirect. Encountering some issues. Will give the update some time and check back.
